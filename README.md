Business Case: Pinky Telecom

Exercise about the churn rate in a telecom company that wanted to reduce the risk of churn, meaning active clients leaving the company.

We got a dataset with some features about the clients wuth some personal features and infos about the different services they have. The dataset resumed a month and included clients that decided to leave Pinky.

The company requested a way to anticipate clients that could be in a situation that could make them quit with the goal of trying to reengage and manage to renew their relation with the company.

We tested two models of supervised prediction and managed to forecast a list of 30 clients that could have 60% or more of churn risk.
